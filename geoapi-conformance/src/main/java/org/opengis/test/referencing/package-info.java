/**
 * Validators and test suites for the {@code org.opengis.referencing} package. The validator classes
 * don't need to be used directly (use the static {@link org.opengis.test.Validators} methods instead),
 * unless implementers want to alter the way that referencing objects are validated.
 *
 * <p>This package provides a {@link org.opengis.test.referencing.TransformTestCase} base class
 * with methods for testing {@link org.opengis.referencing.operation.MathTransform} instances.
 * The various {@code TransformTestCase} fields control different aspects of the test to be run,
 * like the {@linkplain org.opengis.test.referencing.TransformTestCase#tolerance tolerance}
 * threshold for comparing coordinate values or whether
 * {@linkplain org.opengis.test.referencing.TransformTestCase#isDerivativeSupported math transform
 * derivatives are supported}.
 * Implementers can extend this class in order to define their own tests.</p>
 *
 * <p>The {@link org.opengis.test.referencing.ObjectFactoryTest},
 * {@link org.opengis.test.referencing.AuthorityFactoryTest},
 * {@link org.opengis.test.referencing.ParameterizedTransformTest} and other concrete classes
 * can be extended by implementers in order to inherit predefined test cases.
 * Many of those test cases are derived from publications of authoritative sources
 * such as EPSG or national mapping agencies.
 * By extending the test classes directly, implementers can control which factories
 * are used and alter the way the tests are performed as documented in the above-cited
 * {@link org.opengis.test.referencing.TransformTestCase} class.</p>
