/**
 * Defines the origin of an image coordinate reference system. An image datum is used in a local context only.
 * For an image datum, the anchor point is usually either the centre of the image or the corner of the image.
 * The image datum definition applies regardless of whether or not the image is georeferenced.
 * Georeferencing is performed through a transformation of image <abbr>CRS</abbr> to geodetic or projected <abbr>CRS</abbr>.
 * The transformation plays no part in the image datum definition.
 *
 * <p>The image pixel grid is defined as the set of lines of constant integer coordinate values.
 * The term "image grid" is often used in other standards to describe the concept of Image <abbr>CRS</abbr>.
 * However, care must be taken to correctly interpret this term in the context in which it is used.
 * The term "grid cell" is often used as a substitute for the term "pixel".</p>
 *
 * <p>The grid lines of the image may be associated in two ways with the data attributes of the pixel or grid cell.
 * The data attributes of the image usually represent an average or integrated value that is associated with the entire pixel.
 * An image grid can be associated with this data in such a way that the grid lines run through the centres of the pixels.
 * The cell centres will thus have integer coordinate values.
 * In that case the attribute "pixel in cell" will have the value "cell centre".
 * Alternatively, the image grid may be defined such that the grid lines
 * associate with the cell or pixel corners rather than the cell centres.
 * The cell centres will thus have noninteger coordinate values, the fractional parts always being 0.5.
 * The attribute "pixel in cell" will now have the value "cell corner".
 * This difference in perspective has no effect on the image interpretation,
 * but is important for coordinate transformations involving this defined image.</p>
