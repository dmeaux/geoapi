/**
 * Relationship of a Coordinate System (CS) to the Earth, another celestial body or a platform.
 * For {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.crs.GeodeticCRS geodetic}
 * and {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.crs.VerticalCRS vertical}
 * coordinate reference systems (<abbr>CRS</abbr>), the datum is known as <dfn>reference frame</dfn>
 * and shall relate the coordinate system to the Earth or other celestial body.
 * With other types of <abbr>CRS</abbr>s, the datum may relate the coordinate system
 * to another physical or virtual object. It may be a moving platform such as a car.
 * The datum itself is not time-dependent, but any transformations of the associated coordinates
 * to an Earth-fixed or other coordinate reference system may contain time-dependent parameters.
 *
 * <h2>Dynamic reference frame</h2>
 * If the subtype of {@code Datum} is geodetic or vertical, the frame-defining parameters may
 * include time evolution to describe the motions of points used to define the reference frame.
 * Then the geodetic or vertical reference frame is
 * {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.datum.DynamicReferenceFrame dynamic}.
 *
 * @departure integration
 *   The {@code Calendar} code list is omitted because the handling of calendar systems
 *   is delegated to the {@link java.time} framework.
