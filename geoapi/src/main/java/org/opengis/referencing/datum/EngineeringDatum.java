/**
 * Identification of the origin of an engineering (or local) coordinate reference system.
 * An engineering datum is used in a region around that origin.
 * This origin can be fixed with respect to the planet (such as a defined point at a construction site),
 * a defined point on a moving object (such as on a road vehicle, vessel, aircraft or spacecraft),
 * or a point used to describe spatial location internally on an image.
 *
 * <p>When used for a region on a planet, engineering <abbr>CRS</abbr>s use a flat-Earth approximation:
 * corrections for planet-curvature are not applied.
 * Typical applications are for civil engineering construction and building information management.
 * Note that these applications are not restricted to using engineering <abbr>CRS</abbr>s:
 * they often utilize projected and sometimes geodetic <abbr>CRS</abbr>s.</p>
 *
 * <p>When used for an image internal coordinates, the <abbr>CRS</abbr> is not georeferenced.
 * The image can be georeferenced by relating the engineering <abbr>CRS</abbr> to a geodetic
 * or projected <abbr>CRS</abbr> through a coordinate transformation.</p>
