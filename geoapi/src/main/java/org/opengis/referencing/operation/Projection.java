/**
 * A {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.operation.Conversion conversion} transforming
 * (<var>longitude</var>,<var>latitude</var>) coordinates to Cartesian coordinates
 * (<var>x</var>,<var>y</var>). Although some map projections can be represented as a
 * geometric process, in general a map projection is a set of formulae that converts geodetic
 * latitude and longitude to plane (map) coordinates. Height plays no role in this process,
 * which is entirely two-dimensional. The same map projection can be applied to many
 * {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.crs.GeographicCRS geographic CRSs}, resulting in many
 * {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.crs.ProjectedCRS projected CRSs} each of which is related
 * to the same {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.datum.GeodeticDatum geodetic reference frame}
 * as the geographic CRS on which it was based.
 *
 * <p>An unofficial list of projections and their parameters can
 * be found <a href="http://www.remotesensing.org/geotiff/proj_list/">there</a>.
 * Most projections expect the following parameters:
 *  {@code "semi_major"} (mandatory),
 *  {@code "semi_minor"} (mandatory),
 *  {@code "central_meridian"} (default to 0),
 *  {@code "latitude_of_origin"} (default to 0),
 *  {@code "scale_factor"} (default to 1),
 *  {@code "false_easting"} (default to 0) and
 *  {@code "false_northing"} (default to 0).</p>

 *   This interface is not part of the ISO specification. It has been added in GeoAPI at user
 *   request, in order to provide a way to know the kind of map projection.
