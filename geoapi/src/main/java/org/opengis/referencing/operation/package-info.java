/**
 * Coordinate operations (relationship between any two <abbr>CRS</abbr>).
 * If the relationship between any two coordinate reference systems (<abbr>CRS</abbr>) is known,
 * coordinates in one <abbr>CRS</abbr> can be transformed or converted to another <abbr>CRS</abbr>.
 * If the <abbr>CRS</abbr> is dynamic, coordinates also may be referenced to a different coordinate epoch,
 * or to both a different <abbr>CRS</abbr> and different coordinate epoch.
 *
 * <p>The algorithm used to execute a
 * {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.operation.SingleOperation single coordinate operation}
 * is defined in the {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.operation.OperationMethod operation method}.
 * Each operation method can use a number of {@linkplain org.opengis.parameter.ParameterValue parameters},
 * and each single coordinate operation assigns value to these parameters.</p>
 *
 * <p>A coordinate operation (transformation or conversion) can be time-varying,
 * and must be time-varying if either the source or target <abbr>CRS</abbr> is time varying.
 * When the coordinate operation is time-varying, the operation method used will also be time-varying,
 * and some of the parameters used by that operation method will involve time.
 * For example, some of the parameters may have time, velocity, and/or acceleration values and units.</p>
