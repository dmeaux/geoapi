/**
 * Abstract coordinate reference system, consisting of a single
 * {@linkplain CoordinateSystem Coordinate System} and a single
 * {@linkplain Datum Datum} (as opposed to {@linkplain CompoundCRS Compound CRS}).
 * <p>
 * A coordinate reference system consists of an ordered sequence of coordinate system
 * axes that are related to the earth through a datum. A coordinate reference system
 * is defined by one datum and by one coordinate system. Most coordinate reference system
 * do not move relative to the earth, except for engineering coordinate reference systems
 * defined on moving platforms such as cars, ships, aircraft, and spacecraft.
 * <p>
 * Coordinate reference systems are commonly divided into sub-types. The common classification
 * criterion for sub-typing of coordinate reference systems is the way in which they deal with
 * earth curvature. This has a direct effect on the portion of the earth's surface that can be
 * covered by that type of CRS with an acceptable degree of error. The exception to the rule is
 * the subtype "Temporal" which has been added by analogy.
