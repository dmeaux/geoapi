/**
 * Reference systems by coordinates.
 * A {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.crs.CoordinateReferenceSystem Coordinate Reference System}
 * (<abbr>CRS</abbr>) generally consists of one {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.cs Coordinate System}
 * (a set of {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.cs.CoordinateSystemAxis axes} with implied mathematical rules
 * for calculating distances and angles from coordinates) that is related to the Earth, another celestial body
 * or a platform through one {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.datum datum} or datum ensemble.
 *
 * <p>{@code CoordinateReferenceSystem} instances and their components shall be immutable.
 * For <abbr>CRS</abbr> defined on moving platforms such as cars, ships, aircraft and spacecraft,
 * transformation to a planet-fixed coordinate reference system may include a time element.
 * For a dynamic <abbr>CRS</abbr>, locations on or near the surface of the planet will move
 * within the <abbr>CRS</abbr> due to crustal motion or deformation, therefor data needs a
 * {@linkplain org.opengis.coordinate.CoordinateMetadata#getCoordinateEpoch() coordinate epoch}
 * in addition of the <abbr>CRS</abbr>. In both cases, time-variability is handled by
 * coordinate operations rather than changes in the <abbr>CRS</abbr> definition.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Compound <abbr>CRS</abbr></h2>
 * The traditional separation of horizontal, vertical and temporal position has resulted in different interfaces
 * for the horizontal (2D), vertical (1D) and temporal (1D) components. It is established practice to combine the
 * horizontal coordinates of a point with a height or depth from a different <abbr>CRS</abbr>, and sometime a time.
 * The <abbr>CRS</abbr> to which these 3D or 4D coordinates are referenced is called a <dfn>compound</dfn>
 * coordinate reference system.
 *
 * <h2>Derived <abbr>CRS</abbr></h2>
 * Some coordinate reference systems are defined by applying a coordinate conversion to another <abbr>CRS</abbr>.
 * Such a <abbr>CRS</abbr> is called a <dfn>derived</dfn> coordinate reference system and the <abbr>CRS</abbr>
 * it was derived from by applying the conversion is called the <dfn>base</dfn> <abbr>CRS</abbr>.
 * A coordinate conversion is an arithmetic operation with zero or more parameters that have defined values.
 * The base <abbr>CRS</abbr> and derived <abbr>CRS</abbr> have the same datum or datum ensemble.
 * Projected <abbr>CRS</abbr>s are special cases of derived <abbr>CRS</abbr>s.
