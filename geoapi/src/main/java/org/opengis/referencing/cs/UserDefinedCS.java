/**
 * A 2- or 3-dimensional coordinate system that consists of any combination of axes not covered by any other CS type.
 *
 * <div class="note"><b>Example:</b>
 * a multilinear coordinate system which contains one coordinate axis that may have any 1-D shape which has no
 * intersections with itself. This non-straight axis is supplemented by one or two straight axes to complete a
 * 2 or 3 dimensional coordinate system. The non-straight axis is typically incrementally straight or curved.
 * </div>
 *
 * <p>This type of CS can be used by coordinate reference systems of type
 * {@link org.opengis.referencing.crs.EngineeringCRS}.</p>
