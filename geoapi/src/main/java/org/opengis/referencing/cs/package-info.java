/**
 * Coordinate Systems and their axes.
 * A {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.cs.CoordinateSystem coordinate system} (<abbr>CS</abbr>) shall be
 * composed of a non-repeating sequence of {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.cs.CoordinateSystemAxis axes}.
 * Each axis can have have a name, an abbreviation, a unit of measure, a direction and a range of values.
 * The number of axes is the dimension of the coordinate space. Axis order is significant.
 *
 * <p>One {@link org.opengis.referencing.cs.CoordinateSystem} instance may be used by multiple
 * {@link org.opengis.referencing.crs.CoordinateReferenceSystem} (<abbr>CRS</abbr>) instances.
 * The {@linkplain org.opengis.geometry.DirectPosition#getDimension() number of coordinates} in a coordinate tuple
 * shall be equal to the {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.cs.CoordinateSystem#getDimension() number of coordinate axes}
 * in the coordinate system.
 * Coordinates in coordinate tuples shall be supplied in the order in which the coordinate system's axes are defined.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Coordinate system types</h2>
 * A coordinate system implies how coordinates are calculated from geometric elements such as distances and angles
 * and vice versa. These rules are not specified in details, but are implied by the coordinate system interface.
 * Certain sub-interfaces of coordinate system shall be used only with specific sub-interfaces of <abbr>CRS</abbr>.
 * The restrictions are documented in the javadoc of each <abbr>CRS</abbr> subtype.
 *
 * <p>Coordinate system <em>interfaces</em> should not be confused with coordinate system <em>unions</em>.
 * The latter look similar to <abbr>CS</abbr> interfaces, but do not imply a specific set of mathematical rules.
 * A <abbr>CS</abbr> union is only an enumeration of the <abbr>CS</abbr> interfaces that can be associated to a
 * given <abbr>CRS</abbr> interface. Because the Java language has no direct support for unions, the <abbr>CS</abbr>
 * unions defined by {@linkplain org.opengis.annotation.Specification#ISO_19111 ISO 19111} are not part of GeoAPI.
 * They are replaced by Javadoc documenting the constraints.</p>
 *
 * @departure constraint
 *   The {@code GeodeticCS}, {@code EngineeringCS} and {@code DerivedProjectedCS} unions are omitted because unions
 *   are not directly supported in the Java language (they are supported in some other languages such as C/C++).
 *   Unions could be simulated, for example, by defining {@code GeodeticCS} as a parent interface of
 *   {@link org.opengis.referencing.cs.CartesianCS}, {@link org.opengis.referencing.cs.SphericalCS} and
 *   {@link org.opengis.referencing.cs.EllipsoidalCS} (the members of the {@code GeodeticCS} union).
 *   However, it would blur the semantics of subtyping as an “is type of” hierarchy.
 *   For example, a {@code CartesianCS} can be used in non-geodetic contexts.
 *
 * @departure harmonization
 *   The {@code OrdinalCS} and {@code TemporalCountCS} interfaces are omitted because they are about a type
 *   of coordinate values (integers) rather than the mathematical rules implied by the coordinate system.
 *   The {@code DateTimeTemporalCS} interface is omitted for similar reason.
 *   The {@code TemporalMeasureCS} interface is omitted because it behaves like most other axes,
 *   and therefor is adequately covered by the {@code TimeCS} parent interface.
