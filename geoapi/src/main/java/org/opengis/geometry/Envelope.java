/**
 * A minimum bounding box or rectangle. Regardless of dimension, an {@code Envelope} can
 * be represented without ambiguity as two direct positions (coordinate points). To encode an
 * {@code Envelope}, it is sufficient to encode these two points. This is consistent with
 * all of the data types in this specification, their state is represented by their publicly
 * accessible attributes.
 *
 * <h2>Crossing the anti-meridian of a geographic CRS</h2>
 * The <cite>Web Coverage Service</cite> (WCS) 1.1 specification uses an extended interpretation
 * of the bounding box definition. In a WCS 1.1 data structure, the {@linkplain #getUpperCorner()
 * upper corner} defines the edges region in the directions of <em>increasing</em> coordinate
 * values in the envelope CRS, while the {@linkplain #getLowerCorner() lower corner} defines the
 * edges region in the direction of <em>decreasing</em> coordinate values. They are usually the
 * algebraic maximum and minimum coordinates respectively, but not always. For example, an envelope
 * crossing the anti-meridian could have an upper corner longitude less than the lower corner longitude.
 * Whether an envelope supports the extended bounding box interpretation or not is
 * implementation-dependent. If supported, the extended interpretation is applicable only to
 * axes having a {@link RangeMeaning#WRAPAROUND WRAPAROUND} range meaning, which is usually
 * the longitude axis.
 *
 * @departure easeOfUse
 *   The ISO specification defines this interface in the {@code coordinate} sub-package.
 *   GeoAPI moved this interface into the {@code org.opengis.geometry} root package for
 *   convenience, because it is extensively used.
