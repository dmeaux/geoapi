/**
 * Tuple of coordinate values.
 * A <dfn>coordinate</dfn> is one of <var>n</var> scalar values that define the position of a single point.
 * A <dfn>coordinate tuple</dfn> is an ordered list of coordinates that define the position of a single point.
 * The {@linkplain org.opengis.geometry.DirectPosition#getCoordinates() coordinates} within a coordinate tuple
 * are mutually independent, and the number of coordinates is equal to the tuple
 * {@linkplain org.opengis.geometry.DirectPosition#getDimension() dimension}.
 * A <dfn>coordinate set</dfn> is a collection of coordinate tuples referenced to the same
 * {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.crs.CoordinateReferenceSystem coordinate reference system}.
 * A coordinate set does not necessarily describe a geometry.
 *
 * <p>Coordinate tuples can be represented by instances of {@link org.opengis.geometry.DirectPosition}
 * or by plain Java arrays of numbers.</p>
