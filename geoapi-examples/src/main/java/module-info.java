/**
 * Examples of GeoAPI implementations.
 * This implementation is not complete, but can be used as a starting point for implementers.
 * Since every files in this module are placed into the Public Domain,
 * anyone is free to do whatever they wish with those files.
 *
 * <h2>Metadata</h2>
 * The {@link org.opengis.metadata} package and sub-packages contain a large number of interfaces,
 * which may give the impression that implementing metadata is very tedious.
 * However the {@link java.lang.reflect.Proxy} class can provide dynamically generated implementations.
 * The metadata example in this module shows how to implement every metadata interfaces with only two small classes.
 *
 * <h2>Referencing</h2>
 * The ISO 19111 model contains lot of details, some of them being ignored by existing libraries.
 * For example some libraries make no distinction between:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Ellipsoid and Geodetic Reference Frame</li>
 *   <li>Coordinate System and Coordinate Reference System</li>
 *   <li>Coordinate Operation and Math Transform</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * This module follows the path of simpler libraries by merging different ISO concepts in the same class.
 * While this is not a recommended approach for strict ISO 19111 compliance, the intent is to demonstrate
 * that implementers can hide some of the ISO 19111 complexity.
